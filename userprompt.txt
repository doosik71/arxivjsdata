- Guidelines for writing in Markdown format:
  1. Use braces around multi-character subscripts or superscripts in MathJax to avoid rendering errors.
  2. Use $...$ for inline math and $$...$$ for block math to ensure compatibility with MathJax.
  3. Do not use backticks (`) for math; use dollar signs ($) to allow proper MathJax rendering.
