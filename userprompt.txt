Please summarize the following paper.

The summary **must be written in Korean** and **must follow Markdown syntax** using a clear hierarchical structure with headings, bullet points, and formatting where appropriate.
Ensure the content is **concise, accurate, and easy to understand** for a technical but general audience.

Please follow these formatting rules:

- At the very top, display:
  - The **paper title** on the first line as a "#" heading.
  - The **author list** on the second line as plain text (comma-separated), below the title.

- Then use the following summary structure:
  - ## Problem to Solve
    - Clearly describe the main research problem or question the paper aims to address.
  - ## Key Contributions
    - List the core findings and novel contributions as bullet points.
  - ## Methodology
    - Describe the approach or algorithm used, preferably with steps or bullet points.
  - ## Results
    - Summarize quantitative or qualitative results briefly.

- Guidelines for writing in Markdown format:
  1. Use bold formatting only for the main text, not for parentheses or their contents.
  2. Escape underscores in subscripts with a backslash to prevent them from being rendered as italic.
  3. Use braces around multi-character subscripts or superscripts in MathJax to avoid rendering errors.
  4. Use $...$ for inline math and $$...$$ for block math to ensure compatibility with MathJax.
  5. Do not use backticks (`) for math; use dollar signs ($) to allow proper MathJax rendering.
