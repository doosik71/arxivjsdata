Please summarize the following paper.

The summary **must be written in Korean** and **must follow Markdown syntax** using a clear hierarchical structure with headings, bullet points, and formatting where appropriate.

Please follow these formatting rules:

- At the very top, display:
  - The **paper title** on the first line as a "#" heading.
  - The **author list** on the second line as plain text (comma-separated), below the title.

- Then use the following summary structure:
  - ## Problem to Solve
    - Clearly describe the main research problem or question the paper aims to address.
  - ## Key Contributions
    - List the core findings and novel contributions as bullet points.
  - ## Methodology
    - Describe the approach or algorithm used, preferably with steps or bullet points.
  - ## Results
    - Summarize quantitative or qualitative results briefly.
- Use **bold** for emphasis and `inline code` for method names or technical terms.
  - When encountering bold markdown that includes parentheses, such as **text(in parentheses)**, split the bold formatting so that only the main sentence and the parenthetical part are each emphasized separately.
  - For example, convert **sentence(group of words)** into **sentence**(**group of words**).
- If there are equations or mathematical expressions, use "$...$" or "$$...$$" for LaTeX-style math (MathJax compatible).
- Ensure the content is **concise, accurate, and easy to understand** for a technical but general audience.
